<h2>IaaS Permission Mining Tools</h2>
The IaaS permission mining tools are open sourced projects aimed at interpreting permissions assigned to users, groups, etc. in various cloud providers. The tools are meant to find the potential for privilege escalation to give administrators control over the risk their users pose. For more detailed information, see the README file under each sub-directory.
